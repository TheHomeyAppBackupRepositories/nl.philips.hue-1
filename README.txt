The Philips Hue App for Homey makes it easy for you to get the most out of your Hue lights and accessories.

Connect your Philips Hue lights & accessories with Homey. This app requires the Philips Hue Bridge. Connect one or multiple Hue bridges to your Homey Pro, or connect your Hue account to Homey to control your devices.

Please note that 3rd party brands such as IKEA, Osram and other Friends of Hue accessories that are connected to the Hue bridge might work, but are not officially supported.
